### Code Template Experiments

#### Objective
Demonstrate that you understand the technology for this project by successfully using the template code and making modifications to the trivia game. This will frame what is technically feasible for your team's solution.

#### Instructions

**1. Get Started with the template. **Follow the instructions in the [Code Template](/code-template.md) section to get your working trivia app started. These are individual activities. So each student should complete each step. Of course, you can help each other along the way. Just make sure you understand these basic methods in changing the trivia app.

**2. Make some basic style changes.** Recall your previous work with HTML/CSS (e.g. [this](https://cxd.gitbooks.io/intro-to-learning/content/1-3-basic-css.html) and [this](https://cxd.gitbooks.io/intro-to-learning/content/1-4-classes-and-ids.html)) and make the following style changes.
- Change the background of the body and/or the card.
- Change the font family and color of the trivia game title.
- Change the look of the answer buttons. At least change the border, background, color.

**3. Modify the Questions.** Modify the questions in your version of the Google sheet to something that interests you. If step one was completed correctly, you should see your questions in your game.

**4. Add a sound effect.** Determine where you would like to add a sound effect to the game and follow the instructions for adding a sound effect to the trivia game [found in the Code Mods of this GitBook](/code-mods/add-a-sound-effect.md).
