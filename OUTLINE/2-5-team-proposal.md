### Team Proposal

#### Objective

Synthesize a full proposal for presentation. Review your entire work to this point with your team, share it with the class, and collect some final feedback before moving into the more in-depth prototyping.

#### Instructions

1. **Create a presentation of 5-7 slides to share your proposed trivia app with the class.** Include the following elements in your presentation.
         - Trivia App Name
         - Trivia Categories
         - Personas
         - Value Statement (See help below)
         - Sample Questions
         - Image of the Interface Storyboard

2. **Prepare to _discuss_ your proposal rather than _read_ it.** During your presentation include a discussion on the theme of the trivia app, feedback you received on concepts, and any features that you believe make it unique.

#### ✓ Standard Deliverable

Submit your presentation file and present your work.

#### ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Prepare a unique way to enhance your presentation. For example, role play a persona's commentary on the trivia game concept and why that persona is looking forward to using it.

###### Student Example
For `teachers` who `struggle with taking attendance all day or find it distracting to classwork`, `Attendance Checker` is a `device` that `will help make attendance easier for every class period of the day where students initiate the check-in.`
