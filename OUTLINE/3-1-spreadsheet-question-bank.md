#### ✓ Standard Deliverable

Share a link or copy of your spreadsheet.

#### ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Compare and contrast your questions with questions from another trivia game (like in your competitive analysis), and summarize any refinements you made in a document based on the evaluation. You are comparing the manner and structure of the questions and answers, not the content. You can still make comparisons with a trivia game having vastly different topics.
