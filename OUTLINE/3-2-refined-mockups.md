### Refined Mockups

#### Objective

Produce screen mockups that represent the colors, images, font, and any effects you will be using in your trivia game, including any variations between categories. 

#### Instructions

1. Choose a graphics tool that creates editable objects on the page, like Google drawing or the [Marvel Apps](https://marvelapp.com/) interface editor, so that you can easily move, copy, and edit individual objects in your mockups. Do not Microsoft Paint! 
2. Design 6 or more screen mockups to represent all of your trivia game states. For example, you might demonstrate the following, depending on the details of your interaction design.
    - The first screen seen when opening the game with a start button.
    - The category selector screen.
    - An example of a question screen.
    - An example of the visual response to a correct answer.
    - An example of the visual response to an incorrect answer.
    - A screen demonstrating the score or progress changes.
    - A screen that demonstrates how the game will end.
