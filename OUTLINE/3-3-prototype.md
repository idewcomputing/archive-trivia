### Construct a Prototype

#### Objectives

Use [Marvelapp.com](https://marvelapp.com/) to create a dynamic prototype of a complete interaction sequence that represents how your game will work. 

#### Instructions

1. Ensure that your screen mockups are cropped nicely in individual files. If you used Marvel App to create your mockups, you are all ready.
2. If needed, upload your individual image files to Marvel app. 
3. Construct the interaction to simulate how a player will enter the game, select a category, answer a question, get feedback, and progress to the next question.

#### ✓ Standard Deliverable

A shareable link to your Marvel App prototype.

#### ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Notice that, in addition to "clicks and touches", "timed delays" can be used to automatically advance the player in Marvel App. This may help you simulate how your final game will progress. Use some advanced features of Marvel App to make a more representative version of your interaction concepts.
