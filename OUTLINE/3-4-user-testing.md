### Conduct User Testing

#### Objective

Collect thorough feedback on your trivia design concepts with user-testing and summarize your findings before moving into full development.

#### Instructions

1. User-test your prototype with 6 people outside of class by asking them to try your prototype. Provide guidance on how to use your app only as needed. Through careful observation, determine how intuitive the interaction is for them.
2. Record your observations and the feedback you get. Be sure to capture this information during each session or immediately after.  Otherwise, important information may be lost and forgotten.
3. Once your testing is complete, summarize your findings and include actionable design changes for your team to consider.

After the user-testing, make a couple key improvements to your prototype and share it with two of your previous testing participants for more feedback. Summarize this follow up activity in your existing document.
