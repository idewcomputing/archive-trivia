### Plan Development Strategy

#### Objective
Create and maintain a simple, but concise, task-tracking document for your team's trivia app development and keep it up to date. 

#### Instructions

1. Create a simple task-tracking document like [this example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lih8cyYPPIquxhEHlGLWKV0kPq7DoqoDBiiBlS_4VPs/edit?usp=sharing) to track to-do items and issues.
2. Make sure your document is in your group’s folder for easy access. This is for your group to manage activities and needs, but will also help teachers and mentors be aware of the help you need.
3. **Keep it up to date!**

_Note: Your tracking document will also make it easier for your team to report progress to the class periodically._

Share your task-tracking document or provide shareable link to the document.

#### ✓+ Advanced Deliverable
