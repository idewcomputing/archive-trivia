### Create Marketing Cards

#### Objective

Design a compelling marketing card to promote your trivia app.

#### Instructions

1. Create a Google drawing (or another graphics tool, if  you prefer) with dimensions of 3” x 5”. Ensure that the file is in your team folder.
2. Design a card that you will use to promote your team’s trivia game. You will use printed versions to hand out to people and you can also forward digital versions through social media.
3. Use graphic design elements that draw people in visually, but also reflect the look and feel of your trivia game. Get creative! [Try this](https://dribbble.com/search?q=marketing+flyers) for inspiration. 
4. Include a link prominently displayed on the card for people to access your game. Use a placeholder link like ‘http://idewcomputing/masterTrivia’ until you receive your official link. 
5. Be prepared to present your marketing card to the class in the coming days.

#### ✓ Standard Deliverable

Ensure that your team folder (with the app code) is shared with the teacher. 

#### ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Design two variations of your marketing card and get feedback from four or more people to decide which is best.
