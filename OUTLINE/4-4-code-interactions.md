### Code Core Trivia Interaction First, Then Refining Features

#### Objective

Develop and test the core interactions of the trivia game that reflect the high priority design elements.

#### Instructions
1. Focus on getting the main ‘mechanics’ of the app working correctly--the screen sequence, any scoring or timing variables working, etc. Focus less on the color, style, and fancy features at first.  
2. Frequently update your to-do items and issues list with the team as needed. 
3. Be prepared to share your progress and issues that need resolved during class updates.

Remember to refer to the code mods provided in this GitBook.

#### ✓ Standard Deliverable

Document or be prepared to frequently share progress, high priority needs, and team collaboration plans.
