### Conduct Question Testing

#### Objective

Test your questions as possible with at least 10 people to refine and correct your question database. 

#### Instructions

1. Continually add to your question database and refine wording as needed. 
2. Devise a plan to test your questions with people. You may want to do this a couple of ways. One, simply share the trivia questions and answer options verbally by reading them from the database and get feedback. You may also use the functioning (although incomplete) trivia app to have people try the questions.
3. Be prepared to share with the class your findings--including how many people you have tested with, how many questions have been reviewed, and what type of issues you are finding.

#### âœ“ Standard Deliverable

Document or be prepared to frequently share progress, summarize findings from question testing, and team collaboration plans.
