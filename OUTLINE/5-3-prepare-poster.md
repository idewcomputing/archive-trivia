###Create Poster for Presentation

#### Objective
Design a comprehensive poster that summarizes your teams work on the trivia app.

#### Instructions
Your team will create a poster (36” wide by 24” tall) that summarizes your trivia game project.  This poster will be printed and used at the year-end event as part of your presentation and demonstration.

1. Orient team members to the target audience. The poster should be clear and visually interesting to your audience, which will include other students, teachers and administrators, faculty and staff from IUPUI, as well as professionals from local technology companies.
2. Determine what content (text, images, etc.) and visual design (colors, fonts, layout, etc.) you think the poster should have.
3. Create one or more sketches on letter-sized paper as a model of your poster’s design.
4. Create a digital version of your final poster using the template, which has been sized to 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall.  You can add text boxes, insert shapes & images, change the background color, etc.
5. Your team's poster should briefly describe or show:
    - Trivia Game Title
    - An interesting tag line or short description that provides a bit more background to the trivia game purpose.
    - Team Member Names and Team Name
    - A Summary of the process used to Research, Design, Prototype, and Evaluate the trivia app. Consider including elements like the following...
        - Screenshot of a User Persona
        - The Problem Statement
        - Screenshot of a portion of your question database.
        - Concept Sketches
        - Screenshot of Prototype
        - Screenshots of the Game
        - Summary of Key Feedback During the Evaluations

> **Further Tips for Creating Final Poster:**
- Do not use any font size smaller than 18 for text; otherwise, the text will be too small for people to easily read when standing a few feet away.
- Be sure to have sufficient contrast between the color of your text and the background color behind the text.  If background color is dark, then the text color should be light.  If the background is light, then the text should be dark.
- As necessary, zoom in or out to view the poster at different scales when working on it.  Zooming in will allow you to see details as you edit text, resize images, position things, etc.  Zooming out will allow you to see the overall layout.
- Match the visual design of your poster to the visual design of your trivia game.
