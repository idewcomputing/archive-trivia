### Collect Data and Summarize Findings

#### Objective

Continually seek further feedback on your trivia app and make calculated improvements.

#### Instructions
1. Create a Google form survey to ask users of your app for some feedback. You can copy [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpJB2nj25s0GbQvWLpdIyq3rbXqkiCTkFjHwv2rWLzdoNmkw/viewform?usp=sf_link) as starting point.
2. Put a link to your google form on the front page of your app.  
3. Track your results and summarize them after about four days. You want at least 10 responses. You may need to personally ask people to complete the survey if you are not getting enough participation through the app link.
4. Based on feedback, make refinements and add any compelling information to your poster if time permits.
5. Continue fixing and refining any small items that can be completed before presenting your project. But proceed with caution. You don't want to break anything this close to the end.
