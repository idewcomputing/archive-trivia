# Project Challenge

### Develop a web-based trivia app to help your fellow students review course material for other classes in a fun and engaging way.

#### Teams

Teams of 3 students will collaborate to build a _high-quality_ trivia app. Each team will be responsible for:
* determining member roles
* maintaining good communication
* ensuring equitable contributions
* providing clear project updates to the class in a timely manner

#### Final Deliverables

1. **A working trivia app** that has been tested and prepared for demonstration at the semester end event.
* **A poster** (2’ x 3’) summarizing the process of creating your trivia app (including artifacts created, like sketches, prototypes etc.), along with defining features of the final design.
* **A marketing card** (3” x 5”) that promotes your team’s trivia game with classmates and the community.
* **A well-coordinated presentation** that demonstrates the trivia app and explains the process of developing it to visitors to your school.


#### Criteria

**The trivia game must include the following at a minimum.**
* At least four categories of questions covering concepts relevant to students studying for school courses.
* At least 40 total questions.
* A distinct style created by the team.
* A countdown mechanism that encourages each player’s engagement.
* A metric that provides the player with feedback on his or her performance.
* At least two sound effects.
* At least two images.

#### Recommended Production Tools

* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) - for team file management and Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings.
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io) - For code practice exercises. Also a good choice as a code editor for the trivia project.
* [Editey](https://editey.com) - An option for project code editing that works through Google Drive.
* [Marvel App](https://marvelapp.com) - A digital prototyping tool.

#### Basic Rubric

Evaluation of each deliverable may be guided by the simple rubric below, but teachers will adapt as needed.

| ✕  | ✓- | ✓ | ✓+ |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| No reasonable effort made. | A reasonable effort was made, but components of the core expectations were not sufficiently met. | The core expectations of the assignment were sufficiently met, but little advanced work was delivered. | The core expectations were met along with compelling advanced work. | 

#### **Ultimately your work will be assessed by many people during the final presentation. So teams should carefully consider the perspective of visitors that may have no prior knowledge of your project.**
