# Project Background

## Why Do This Project?

Of course you are going to create an awesome trivia game to benefit others, but you will also get first-hand experience in informatics and computing that reflect great opportunities in the field. You will...

* **Build skills** in the digital arts, programming, and data.
* **Collaborate with a team** where tech skills, people skills, and design skills overlap.
* **Increase your intuition, confidence, and curiosity**  in solving problems using a ‘_design, build and test_’ pattern common with scientific thinking, creative thinking, and critical thinking.

## What's Different About This?

This is different than learning from a textbook. While you are encouraged to complete tutorials in a particular skill area to build expertise, this project will challenge you in the following ways.

* **Independent and Interdependent Learning** - You will often have to search out information on your own, experiment, make mistakes, and try again. You will also do this in groups with peers, mentors, teachers, and professionals.
* **Managing Ambiguity** - Since you will be creating a unique solution, you will not be given a recipe on how to complete many tasks.  You will often evaluate the context of problems quickly and decide on a plan of action that makes sense.
* **Collaborating** - You will have to be a productive team member, fulfilling a role, communicating clearly, and valuing each team member's views at decision points.
* **Presentation** - Your team will often present work to the class, and occasionally to visitors, to get feedback and share ideas with other teams.

## Key Concepts

You will investigate the following key concepts related to computing.

### Information Structure

How computers can store and represent information. `HTML, Spreadsheet Tables, and CSV files`

### Information Presentation

How humans see and organize information, and how to create visual interfaces. `Interface design, CSS, Data Charts, and Illustration`

### Information Processing

How humans make decisions and choose actions, and how computers process data and interactions. `Interaction Design, Task Analysis, JavaScript, Spreadsheet Functions, Descriptive Statistics`

## Key Practices

### Critical and Computational Thinking

You will practice independent-learning to become confident in obtaining valuable information and understanding the leverage computers can offer to solve problems.

### Creative Thinking

You will often use divergent thinking and a “design, build, test” cycle that supports an agile environment rooted in the scientific method and common creative processes.

### Collaboration + Communication

You will thoughtfully reflect on techniques and attitudes for successful collaboration and communication in project groups, as well as sharing your work with those outside of class.

## Implementation Suggestions

While this digital book guides your project work, below are important suggestions for a well-rounded learning experience using supplemental activities.

**Skill Building** - Include independent learning time in the three core areas of digital arts, programming, and data. Use online tutorials like CodeHS, Codecademy, and Kahn Academy to learn at your own pace. Try learning in each of the three core areas breifly. Then "specialize" in one.

**Exploration and Discovery** - Opportunities to discover the larger world of opportunities in technology are important.

* Visits from industry professionals and visiting companies are great for exposure. 
* Create reports on "Tech Trends" or "Tech Careers" to research your specific interests and curiosities. Provide written reports and presentations to your class, so all students benefit from your findings.

**Weekly Schedule** - A predictable pattern to the week may help. For example...

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project | Project | Project | Independent Skills | Visitors & Exploration Reports |
